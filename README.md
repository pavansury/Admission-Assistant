# Admission Assistant

An intelligent IoT-based admission assistant system that helps students with admission-related queries using voice interaction and machine learning.

## Features
- Speech-to-Text (STT) processing
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) responses
- Machine Learning-based query understanding
- FAQ database for admission information
- Arduino-based embedded system

## Project Structure
